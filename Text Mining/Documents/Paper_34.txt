Abstract--Mining sequential patterns is an important issue in data mining and has many applications. An extended work of sequential pattern mining, called time-interval sequential pattern mining, is proposed to retrieve time-interval information between successive items. However, previous work only considers singlelevel time-interval in pattern extraction, which means sequential patterns with cross-level time-intervals are completely ignored. Therefore, this study first defines multi-level time-interval sequential patterns and then presents a novel algorithm, named MLTI-PrefixSpan, for discovering the complete set of multi-level time-interval sequential patterns. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effective on the test dataset.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, the rapid advancement of information technology has accumulated explosive data of enterprises. Many data mining techniques have been developed to extract potentially useful information from databases [1][2]. Among these techniques, sequential pattern mining is one of the most important data mining techniques [3][4], which discovers patterns occurred frequently in a sequence database. Since sequential patterns only unfold the time order among events (or itemsets), they do not provide the time span between any two successive events. To solve this problem, Chen et al. [5] extended traditional sequential pattern mining method that can find a time-interval sequential pattern. These time-interval sequential patterns reveal the information of not only the time order of the itemsets but also the time-interval between two successive itemsets. A typical example of time-interval sequential pattern is that after buying a laptop, a customer often returns to upgrade memory module within three months and then hard disk within a half year.
Although a time-interval sequential pattern carry more information than the plaint sequential patterns, the timeintervals information attached in sequential patterns may still be insufficient for some decision support problems. For example, assume there are two time-interval sequential pattern, < a, 1 week, b > and < b, 5 months, c >, which consider the time unit as week and day, respectively. In business, we may need to combine these two patterns as < a, 1 week, b, 5 months, c > to discover the long-term behaviors of customers. In the previous work [5], they only consider time-intervals of single

unit in mining the patterns. In other words, they did not consider the different time units and their hierarchical relationship in their algorithm; it is of no way to get this useful pattern, like < a, 1 week, b, 5 months, c >, through the approach. This paper first defined multi-level time-interval patterns (or MLTI-pattern in short) and then proposed the associate algorithm (called MLTI-PrefixSpan algorithm) to overcome the problem addressed in the above. Users can define various granularities of time-intervals and find sequential patterns with arbitrary lengths of time-intervals according to their needs. Consider Fig. 1, which shows a hierarchical structure depicting the relationship of time interval between two events in the sequential patterns. In this example, the root node (quarter node) in level 1 is divided into three month nodes in level 2, and the month node in turn is divided into four week nodes in level 3, and the week node is divided into seven day nodes in last level. What kind of time-interval should we set is depended on the requirement of user. As a point view of a supermarket manager, he want to know how long did the customers buy milk by weeks, months, quarters.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the relevant literature of sequential pattern mining is discussed. The problem of mining multi-level time-interval sequential is formally defined in Section 3 and the MLTI-algorithm is introduced in Section 4. To show the performance of the proposed algorithm, a variety of experiments are performed. Section 5 provides the results of experimental evaluations, compared with ours and others for single-level time-interval. Section 6 gives the conclusion and future work.

II. RELATED WORK
According to the literature, the algorithms for mining timeinterval sequential patterns can be divided into three classes, namely, ignoring the time interval, time-window approach , and considering the intervals but without hierarchical concepts between two successive events.
First of all, methods by ignoring the time interval are introduced by [3][6][7].Those uncovered patterns are addressed on the temporal order of items instead of any time interval. For instance, there are four items in a sequence pattern (item1, item 2, item3, item4), however, we only know the item1 occurs at first, and then item 2 occurs after item 1, and so on.
Secondly, many researches provide ideas of specifying the length of time window. For example, [8] let user to define the width of the time window to find frequent episodes in sequences of event. By this way, we can find two types of episode: serial episodes and parallel episodes. For example, Assume episode  is a serial episodes; therefore, four items a, b, c and d happens by this order. But there is no evidence that these four items are separated by certain time intervals. On the contrary, assume episode  is a parallel episode, which has a, b, c and d occurs in a time range but in unknown order and separated by unknown interval. Wu et al. [9] devised a process for mining alarm sequential patterns from the alarm data of a mobile system. Particularly, an urgent window  is defined as the user-specified time interval, which is set to determine the maximal time difference is allowed if two events are to be viewed relevant to each other. For instance, assume a sequential alarm pattern (e, f, g, h) with  set to five seconds. Event e happens at first, then f, occurs after e and so on. And the time interval between e and f, are within five seconds, f, and g as well. However, this work didn't focus other potential timeintervals between events.
At last, [5] devised a method that concisely finds the timeintervals between successive items. It can obtain the timeinterval sequential patterns like "(a, (1~7), b (15~21), c)". It means that a customer who has bought a will buy b within September 1th to September 7th. Similarly, after buying b, a customer will buy c with high probability within September 15th to September 21th. By this way, we can set different timeintervals according to our interests. This work developed two algorithms which are modified from Apriori [10] and PrefixSpan [7]. The former algorithm employs level-wise concept and incorporate support threshold to reduce unwanted patterns. And the latter adopts the tree-projection concept to divide the database into several sections. Nevertheless, we only can divide the time lines by single granularity of time-level. For example, time-level is determined as 7 days, a time-interval sequential pattern can be found as"(a, (1~7), b, (15~21), c)".Consequently, A pattern"(a, (1~7), b, (15~28), c)" can never be discovered by this approach.
Since [5] cannot find the different granularities of timeintervals between two successive items, this research proposes an efficient algorithm to discover multi-level time-interval sequential patterns, called MLTI-PrefixSpan which is modified from I-PrefixSpan [5].

III. PROMLEM DEFINITION
Let I denote the set of items in the database and | I| denote the number of items in set I. The subset of I is called an itemset. A customer's data-sequence is an ordered list of itemsets associated with time stamps. For example, a data-sequence, , can be represented as an ordered list, <(a1: t1), (a2: t2), (a3: t3), ..., (am: tm)>, where ai is an itemset (i.e., ai  I), ti (1 d i dm) is the time stamp in which time ai occurs, and ti-1 d ti for 2 d i d m. Without loss of generality, the items in each itemset are sorted in alphabetical order. Thus, the expression of a sequence is unique in this paper.

In business, the concept of time interval can be seen as a

hierarchy; for example, the business always divides the time

interval for analyzing its sales in the in different granularities of

time unit, such as a hierarchy of years, quarters, months and

days. Let a time hierarchy denote as TI, TI p denote the pth

granularity level in TI, and | TI p | denotes the size of granularity

of TI p . For a time hierarchy TI, we assume that TI is

composed by a set of different granularity of time unit,

TI1, TI 2 , ..., TI k , or denoted as TI = { TI1 , TI 2 , ..., TI k },

where TI p (1pk) denotes the pth granularity level, and

| TI p | < |TI p1 |. We let TI k be the set of smallest time-interval

units considered, and TI k1 , TI k2 , ..., TI 1 be arranged in

decreasing granularity. For example, a typical set of granularity

level in transaction databases is TI = {years, quarters, months,

days}. Let

TI p

= { TI1p ,

TI

p 2

,

...,

TI

p s

},

where

TI

of

Definition 1. Let E = ( b1 , &1 , b2 , &2 , b3 , ... , bn1 , &n1 , bn ) be a multi-level time-interval sequence (MLTI-sequence), where bj is an itemset and &j is a multi-level time-interval (&j TI, 1djdn). Given a data-sequence =((a1: t1), (a2: t2), (a3: t3), ..., (am: tm)), we say  occurs in , or is a subsequence of  if integers 1 d i1 < i2 < ...< in d m exist such that,

Definition 2. A sequence database S is formed by a set of records < sid, s >, where s is a data-sequence and sid is the identifier of this data-sequence. For a given sequence , its support count in S can be defined as follows:

supportS() = |{(sid, s)| (sid, s)S   is a subsequence in s}

Example 2. Consider the sequence database shown in

Table. I and Table. II with TI={ TI 1 , TI 2 , TI 3 } The MLTI-

sequence ( a,

TI12 ,e,

TI

3 2

,c)

includes three items, and therefore

has a length of 3. It is called a 3-time-interval sequence. The

multi-level

sequence

(

a

in the database.

Definition 3. Each granularity level p in TI has its minimum support threshold, denote as minsup( TI p ). Given a time-interval sequence  = (b1, &1, b2, &2, b3, ..., bn-1, &n-1, bn), the minsup of time interval &j, denoted as minsup(&j), is equal to minsup( TI p ) if &j TI p . Moreover, the minsup of , denoted as minsup(), is equal to: min(minsup(&1),minsup(&2),...,minsup(&n-1)).
Definition 4. follow Definition 3, a time-interval sequence  is called a multi-level time-interval sequential pattern (MLTIpattern) iff supportS()minsup().

IV. THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM
This section presents our efficient algorithm called multilevel time-interval PrefixSpan(MLTI-PrefixSpan) for mining multi-level time-interval sequential patters from databases. The I-PrefixSpan algorithm [5] extends the classic PrefixSpan [7] so that it can tackle the time-intervals between items in sequence data. However, we extend the I-PrefixSpan algorithm to find multi-level time-interval sequential patterns , which can be determined from sequence data with time intervals across different levels. First of all, the definition prefix, projection, posfix and projected database are introduced .Then our algorithm can be determined on these definitions. Last, there is an example to illustrate our concept.

Definition 5. Given a data-sequence D =((a1: t1), (a2: t2), (a3: t3), ..., (am: tm)) and a MLTI-sequence E = (b1, &1, b2, &2,
b3, ..., bn-1, &n-1, bn) (n d m), where bj is an itemset and &j is a multi-level time-interval (&j TI, 1djdn). E is a multi-level

time-interval prefix (MLTI-prefix) of if and only if (1) bj= aj
for 1djd(n-1); (2) bn an ; (3)all the items in (an - bn) are alphabetically after those in bn ; and(4) tj - tj-1 satisfies the condition of &j-1 for 1< i d ( n  1 ).

Example 3. Suppose TI={ TI 1 , TI 2 , TI 3 },where

TI 1

={

TI11

},

TI

2

={

TI12

,

TI

2 2

,

TI

2 3

},

TI 3

={

TI13

,

TI

3 2

,

TI

3 3

,...

TI

3 8

,

TI

3 9

}.Then,

E

=( ab,

TI13 ,ce,

TI13 ,a) is a multi-level time-

interval sequential subsequence of D =( (ab,1), (ce,3) (ab,4),

(ae,6), (c,10) ).The first and second in both D and E are

matched and third itemsets of E , (a) , which is contained in

the third itemsets of D , (ae). Furthermore, the multi-level

time-interval between (ab) and (ce) is TI13 which means that (ce) happens after (ab) in first day to ninth day.

Definition 6. Follow Definition 5, assume E is a MLTI-
subsequence of D . Let i1< i2<...<in be the indexes of the elements in  that match the element of . A subsequence D ' =((a1',t1'), (a2',t2'), (a3',t3')..., (av',tv')) of sequence D , where v = (n+m-in ), is called a projection of D with respect to E if and only if (1) E is a multi-level time-interval prefix of
D ' and (2) the last (m-in) elements of D ' are the same as the last (m-in) elements of D ' .

Example 4. If D = ((a,1), (c,3), (ab,4), (ae,6), (c,10)) is projected with respect to E =(a), consequently, we can find
three difference projection D ' . One is ((a,1), (c,3), (ab,4), (ae,6), (c,10)), another is ((ab,4), (ae,6), (c,10)),and the other is ((ae,6), (c,10)). The prefix E occurs in D at position 1 is D ' =
((a,1), (c,3), (ab,4), (ae,6), (c,10)), where the last four elements are the same as those of D . Corresponding to position 3, D ' = ( (ab,4), (ae,6), (c,10)), where the last two elements are the same as those of D . And the last position is in the same way.
Definition 7. Let D ' = ((a1',t1'), (a2',t2'), (a3',t3'),...(aw',tw')) be the projection of D with respect to a MLTI-prefix E = (b1,
&1, b2, &2, b3, ..., bn-1, &n-1, bn'). Therefore, J =

418

((an'' ,tn'),(an+1',tn+1'), (an+2',tn+2'),...,( aw',tw')) is called the postfix of D with respect to prefix E , where <an''= an'- bn' >.

Example 5. We can extend the previous example. According to our definition of postfix , it can be found just by eliminating the prefix from the projection. The postfix J of
D ' = ((a,1), (c,3), (ab,4), (ae,6), (c,10)) is (c,3), (ab,4), (ae,6), (c,10) by cutting the prefix. Eventually, the D -projected
database is denoted by S |D , which is the collection of postfixes of sequence in database S with respect to D .

The classic PrefixSpan method use the strategy of divide and conquer. At the first step of algorithm, D is set as null and discover all of the frequent 1-patterns in D -projected database

S |D .Then , append each frequent 1-pattern called b to D in order to form a sequential pattern D ' and construct the D ' -

projected database S |D ' . By this way, we can find all the sequential patterns in S by recursively identifying the

sequential patterns in S |D ' . Moreover, I-PrefixSpan incorporate

time-interval relationship between item b in S |D and the last item in D . In order to deal with this problem, I-PrefixSpan

create a Table which is used to store this type of time-interval relation such as "0, 1~3, 4~6, 7~ f ". We use this Table in our lowest level of time granularity. For example in Fig.2, if we

have three level of time-intervals, TI={ TI 1 , TI 2 , TI 3 }. A table Table is used to store the relationship between a frequent item b in S |D and the last item in D , where each column
corresponds to an item and each row correspond to a kind of

multi-level

time-interval

relations

be called again with different parameters for each different D ' . Suppose the case with D ' =(a). The process MLTI-

PrefixSpan((a),1, S |(a) ) is used where the projected database

S |(a) is demonstrated as follows.

[10:1] ((c, 3) (a b, 4), (a, 6), (e, 6), (c, 10))

The

pattern

means that e happens after a in first day to ninth day and c

happens after e in fourth day to ninth day. It can prove our

approach can derive different time level in sequence data and

has more specific time-intervals than another. Although (a TI12 ,

e, TI12 , c) didn't achieve our purpose, there will be more

itemsets occurred after it with higher probability than (a TI12 , e,

V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
This section compares the performance between the IPrefixSpan[5] algorithm and the MLTI-PrefixSpan algorithms on a synthetic dataset. Both two algorithms are implemented in Java language and tested on a Pentium E2200 2.2G Windows XP system with 768MB of main memory and JVM(J2RE 1.40_01) as the Java execution environment. Table VII lists the parameters of our data generator. The parameter

420

setting is as follows: D =125,000, C =10, T =2.5, S =4,

I =1.25, Ns =5000, N I =25,000, N =10,000, TIL =3. The

TIL is a new parameter designed for setting the number of

time-interval level. Consequently , the multi-level time-

interval in our experiments is set to TI={ TI1 , TI 2 ,

The runtime comparison is showed in Fig.4 and Fig.5,

where the minimum support are 0.75%, 1% and 1.5%. As our

expectation, the performance of MLTI-PrefixSpan is inferior

to I-PrefixSpan. This is because the I-PrefixSpan only find

single-level time-interval sequential patterns at a time while

MLTI-PrefixSpan simultaneously finds three-level time-

intervals as well as their correlations at the same time. The

results also show that MLTI-PrefixSpan can discover more

time-interval patterns, especially cross-level time-interval

sequential patterns, and provide more information for users.

VI. CONCLUSIION
This work proposes a novel multi-level time-interval sequential pattern mining algorithm. We incorporate the multilevel time-interval concept into sequential pattern mining. Specifically, our method can find cross-level patterns from sequence database instead of single-level time-interval. Traditional method can only set single-level time-interval at a time. It simply assumes the time-interval in patterns cannot involve various time-interval granularities, which is not often the case in real-life applications. In this study, we define MLTI-patterns and propose an efficient algorithm, called MLTI-PrefixSpan, to find all multi-level time-interval information in sequence databases. This method can be used in various applications, such as marketing strategy, analyzing web log and so on.
